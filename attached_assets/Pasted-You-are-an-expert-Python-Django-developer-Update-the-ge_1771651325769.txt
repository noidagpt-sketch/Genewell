You are an expert Python/Django developer. Update the genewell.in application according to the following specifications:

1. **Data Model** – Create or extend a Django model (e.g., UserProfile) to store all quiz fields from the provided image (name, email, phone, age, gender, location, craving, language, dna_upload, eating_out, tired_time, sleep_hours, wake_up_time, weight_goal, meals_per_day, stress_level, energy_levels, mood_patterns, skin_concerns, work_schedule, activity_level, digestive_issues, hunger_frequency, hydration_habits, supplement_usage, food_intolerances, bleeding_frequency, medical_conditions, exercise_preference). Use appropriate field types.

2. **Validation** – In the form processing view, if gender == 'male' and medical_conditions contains 'pcos', remove it (or raise a validation error). Log a warning for admin review.

3. **PDF Report – Summary Paragraph** – After the macronutrient section, add the exact paragraph:
   "At {age} years with a BMI of {bmi:.1f} (weight {weight_kg} kg), your BMR is {bmr:.0f} kcal and your estimated TDEE is {tdee:.0f} kcal, which frames a controlled plan for healthy {goal_text}. Your macro target ({protein:.0f} g protein, {carbs:.0f} g carbs, {fats:.0f} g fats) supports lean mass accrual while addressing metabolic risk. Low activity ({activity_score}/100), very low energy ({energy_score}/100) and poor sleep ({sleep_score}/100) are limiting recovery and performance. Prioritizing sleep, insulin‑sensitive nutrition and gradual resistance training will be key to safe, sustainable gains."
   Use mappings from the quiz strings to scores (e.g., 'very-low' → 15, etc.) and derive goal_text from weight_goal.

4. **Essential Plan Lab Tests** – When the user has purchased the Essential plan, include 2–4 basic lab tests based on their profile. Use the logic provided (always Vitamin D + CBC, then conditionally add tests for PCOS, thyroid, vegetarian, digestive issues, heavy bleeding, or BMI/age). Render them in a simple table.

5. **Premium Add‑Ons (Admin & Display)**  
   a. Create a Django model `PremiumAddOn` with fields: name, slug, description, detailed_description, price_inr (integer, 99–799), image, is_active, and conditional fields (gender_required, min_activity_score, required_conditions).  
   b. Register it with Django Admin so that admins can add/edit/delete add‑ons.  
   c. In the PDF generation, call a function `get_relevant_addons(user)` that returns only the active add‑ons matching the user's gender, activity score, and health conditions.  
   d. At the end of the PDF, add a "Premium Add‑Ons (Optional)" section listing each relevant add‑on with its name, short description, price (in ₹), and a call‑to‑action (e.g., a QR code linking to a purchase page).  
   e. The purchase page should handle payment (Razorpay/Stripe) and associate the add‑on with the user.

6. **Fix Known Errors**  
   - Remove duplicate magnesium from supplement list – keep only magnesium glycinate (300–400 mg before bed).  
   - Replace any broken hydration code (e.g., `Math.round`) with the actual calculated value: `f"{user.weight_kg * 0.033:.1f} L/day"`.  
   - Ensure all gender‑specific sections (like Men's Performance Pack, Women's Hormonal Health) are conditionally included based on user gender.

7. **Testing** – Test with the sample user "mohan" (male, 18, 80kg, 175cm, activity lightly-active, energy very-low, sleep less-than-5, medical conditions "pcos", etc.) to confirm:
   - Summary paragraph uses correct mapped scores.
   - Essential lab tests do NOT include PCOS tests.
   - Relevant premium add‑ons are displayed (e.g., Men's Performance Pack, DNA Guide, etc.) and prices are between ₹99 and ₹799.
   - No duplicate magnesium or broken code.

8. **Deployment** – Ensure all migrations are applied and the admin panel shows the new PremiumAddOn model with full CRUD capabilities.

Provide the updated code with clear comments and ensure it runs without errors.
